#### 1. Overview of the Analysis

**Purpose**

We need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then we wrote a report that summarizes our analysis to help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

#### 2. Results

**Major Points**

- Under the retiring_titles.csv file we can see how many people of each title are retiring from their position so these are what we need to hire for. In terms of managers there are 2 retiring which we need to account for or manage with but the workforce there is a bit over 70,000 that we need to start hiring for over the next upcoming years.

- Under the unique_titles.csv file it allows us to see the employees name, employees number, and their title. This makes it easier for us to look up specific employees' files that we are looking for.

- Under the mentorship_eligibilty.csv we can determine the eligibility of all the employees. It shows their birth date as well as the starting date for their time in the company.

- As we make our files we see that the mentorship_eligibility.csv has all the data we have made combined to see it in a cleaner frame.

#### 3. Summary

**Questions**

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

- We are going to need to start to hire for 2 Managers, 1090 Assistant Engineers, 3603 Technique Leaders, 7636 Staff members, 9285 Engineers, 24926 Senior Staff members, and 25916 Senior Engineer members.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

- There is a little over 1500 employees in the department that are retirement ready and prepared to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. We would need to have a strict and precise hiring/training plan because there are over 70,000 employees retiring in the next few years. So in comparision there is not enough mentors.

**Additional Queries**

- We can make more queries to show exactly which employees, along with their titles, are retiring year by year to better prepare for future hires and staffing needs.

- Expand mentorship eligibility by adjusting the query to capture current employees whose birth dates are outside of the current one year eligibility criteria.
